in vim <:help key-notation > show keys like 

notation meaning            = it shows Mappings
<CR>     carriage return 
so CR means usually Enter key in normal keyboard


Why <special keys> ?

While i can use literal keys in mapping definitions (the Enter key would appear as ^M, or even
just as an addiational new line, depanding on the settinfgs), 
Vim provides a special key notation for key (combinations), so that is is easier to define 
(it means i don't have to use <i_CTRL-V> to literally insert the special character) and
understand (<A-a> better expresses the intention than the equivalent รก) the mappings.


so how can i know about mapping ??
